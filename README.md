# NetPractice

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by jd-halle.*

## Description

NetPractice is a networking exercise to learn the basics of TCP/IP. The project has 10 levels where you configure small networks to make them work correctly.

**Goal**: Learn how to set up IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables so devices can communicate through routers.

## Instructions

### Compilation / Installation

To install this project, ensure you have [the necessary tools, e.g., make, gcc, etc.]. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jd-halle/NetPractice.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd NetPractice
```
3. Compile the source files (if necessary):
```
make
```
### Execution

To run the training interface (e.g., an HTML page):

1. Open the index.html file in your browser.

2. You can interact with the network configuration and try to solve different networking problems at each level.

## Resources

### Networking Concepts

In this project, I focused on learning and applying the following networking concepts:

1. **TCP/IP Addressing**: Understanding how IP addresses are assigned and structured in network communication.

2. **Subnet Masks**: Learning how subnetting works to divide a network into smaller, manageable sub-networks.

3. **Default Gateway**: Understanding the role of the default gateway in routing traffic between different networks.

3. **Routers and Switches**: Learning how routers direct traffic between networks and how switches manage data flow within a network.

4. **OSI Layers**: Understanding the seven layers of the OSI model and how they help in the communication process between devices on a network.

### AI USAGE

AI played a key role in helping me understand and apply these networking concepts:

1. Learning Subnetting: AI tools helped me practice and master subnetting, including calculating subnet masks and understanding IP address ranges.

2. Concept Reinforcement: Throughout the project, AI was used as a resource for reinforcing network concepts, providing explanations, and offering interactive learning experiences.
